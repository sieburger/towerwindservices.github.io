The Tower Wind Services was born from the need of the market of specialized services for the development of wind farms that integrated knowledge, experience and agility in the services of anemometry measurements and telecommunications.   

With experience in the telecommunications area in the installation of irradiating systems for several cellular operators from 2012 we started activities in the area of wind energy in the prospecting of winds with experiences acquired from pioneers in Brazil.

Our mission is to provide services in the area of wind energy in the prospection of data for parks projects, as well as the development of new information technologies.

##### WIND ENERGY

**Communication and Data Acquisition Solutions**  

Among the main needs of successful projects is the safety of a good data communication system that allows the identification of failures in the measurement system.

**WHO WE ARE**

**Instrumentation of anemmometric stations**

A fundamental part of a project, the measurement campaign is also one of the most critical points where precision, quality, knowledge and agility in services are necessary to achieve objectives.

Tower Wind Services performs services of instrumentation, installation and maintenance of systems of measurement of winds.

#####  STRATEGIES

Within the national and international safety standards we follow the rules for good practices for the installation of anemometric towers for the study of wind potential.

We present communication solutions for wind monitoring and measurement systems. Installation and maintenance of telecommunications equipment, IP cameras,
monitoring of atmospheric discharges and notorious beacon systems.

##### TELEMETRY SOLUTIONS

Among the main needs of successful projects is the security of a good data communication system that allows the identification of failures in the measurement system, allowing the most immediate correction, minimizing costs as well as data and time losses.
